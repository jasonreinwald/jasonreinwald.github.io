         In 1991, Jason Reinwald purchased Jason Cafe in Pismo Beach just before the annual Clam Festival in October. That incredibly busy beginning was just the start of a 20+ year journey that has seen Reinwald improve the clam chowder recipe that is now award-winning and world famous, expand to a second location in San Luis Obispo, ship the chowder fresh frozen nationally, distribute in Costco stores and other restaurants and start a gourmet catering division. It’s Jason Cafe’s customer loyalty and their insistence on using the highest quality ingredients that has caused chowder sales to grow from 5000 gallons a year in 1991 to over 40,000 gallons a year between the two restaurants.
