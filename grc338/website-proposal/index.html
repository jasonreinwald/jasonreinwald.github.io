            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Little Shop of Pets</p>
            
            <p>Little Shop of Pets is a small pet company that provides the basics for pet care. They also provide a place for pets to be adopted in the store. The reason people will want to go to this site would be to book pet care appointments or search for an item that they might need for their pets.</p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>This shop would be focused on people who live locally. The friendly atmosphere would bring customers coming back for their pet supplies and pet care.</p>
           
            <p>The tasks at hand are to provide customers with options for different pet essentials such as food, hygene, and toys. The goal is for customers to be able to bring their pets in and have a cozy place to go and pick up supplies from. There is also a veterniaran on staff that can examine pets if they need care, or advice on what sort of care the pet needs.</p>
